# Last Digit of a Huge Number

> For a given std::list&lt;int&gt; `{ x1, x2, x3, ..., xn }`, compute the last (decimal) digit of `x1 ^ (x2 ^ (x3 ^ (... ^ xn)))`.
> * Assume 0 <sup>0</sup> = 1
> * Treat an empty list as equal to 1
> * Powers grow exponentially: 9 <sup>9 <sup>9</sup></sup> has more than 369 million digits. `last_digit()` must deal with them efficiently.
>
> Example
> ```
> last_digit({ 3, 4, 2 }) == 1
> Â» 3 ^ (4 ^ 2) = 3 ^ 16 = 43,046,721
> ```
