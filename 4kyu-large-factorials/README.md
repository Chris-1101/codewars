# Large Factorials

> In mathematics, the factorial of an integer `n`, written `n!`, is equal to the product of `n` and every integer preceding it.  
> For example: `5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120`.
>
> Write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the value of `n!`.
> * You are guaranteed an integer argument.
> * For any values outside the non-negative range, return an empty string `""`.
> * For non-negative numbers, return a full length number as a string.
> * You will be expected to handle large numbers.
>
> Example
> ```
> factorial(25) == "15511210043330985984000000"
> ```
