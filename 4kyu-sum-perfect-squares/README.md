# Sums of Perfect Squares

> Given an integer `n` (`3 < n < 109`), find the length of the smallest list of perfect squares which add up to `n`.
>
> ```
> sum_of_squares(17) = 2
> 17 = 16 + 1 (4 and 1 are perfect squares).
> sum_of_squares(15) = 4
> 15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1. There is no way to represent 15 as the sum of three perfect squares.
> sum_of_squares(16) = 1
> 16 itself is a perfect square.
